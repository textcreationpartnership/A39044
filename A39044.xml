            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE EXECUTION OF <hi>Iames Halloway:</hi> Who was Drawn, Hang'd and Quarter'd at <hi>Tyburn</hi> For High-Treaſon, On <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> the 30th. of this Inſtant <hi>April.</hi> 1684</head>
            <p>
               <hi>JAmes Halloway,</hi> was one of thoſe Execrable Villains who by a late horrid and Diabolical, Conſpiracy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the Laws of God and Nature? the ſacred Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Duty and Allegience to ſo good a Prince: Plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and deſign'd the murther of his Moſt Sacred Majeſty, and his Illuſtrious Brother the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſubverſion of this Imperial Monarchie both in Church and State. But ſuch was the abundant mercy of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, whoſe Divine Providence more Eminently ſheilds and defends the Thrones and Lives of Princes (his own Vicegerents) all their damn'd machinations were brought to Light, and all the ſteps they had made in this their Helliſh Conſpiracy detected and prevented: And as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Falſe Traytors have upon their Tryals been convicted, attainted and executed, according to Law, ſo Vengeance in due time overtook this Notorious Criminal tho he had fled from Juſtice, and the deſerved puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch Notorious Treaſons.</p>
            <p>He was born at <hi>Warwick,</hi> and afterwards put Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to a <hi>Linnen-Draper</hi> and liv'd at <hi>Briſtow,</hi> where he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways appeared a zealous man, for promoting and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging Sedition in the Government, and Schiſm in the Church. Upon the diſcovery of the late Plot, divers of the Conſpirators having notice of Warrants iſſued out for
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58995:2"/>their apprehenſion abſconded themſelves, and made their Eſcape, and amongſt others, <hi>James Halloway</hi> fled to <hi>Nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis</hi> in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> where he changed his Name, and diſguiſed his Perſon: But his Correſpondent there, either from Principles truly Juſt and Loyal, or from ſome heats &amp; animoſities which aroſe between them upon the State<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their accompts, diſcovered him to the Honorable Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Burt</hi> Deputy Governour, to be that falſe Tray for <hi>James Halloway,</hi> who immediately ſeized him, and ſent him over a priſoner to <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On <hi>Monday</hi> the 21ſt of this Inſtant <hi>April;</hi> he was brought from <hi>Newgate</hi> to <hi>Weſtminſter-hall,</hi> and at the <hi>Kings-bench bar</hi> was demanded what he had to ſay for himſelf, why Execution ſhould not be awarded againſt him, he ſtanding at the ſame time attainted by Out-lary, upon an Indictment of <hi>High-Treaſon</hi> for Conſpiring the Death of the King, and the utter Ruin and Subverſion of the Government, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he deſired to hear the Indictment read, which was accordingly done. Mr. <hi>Attorney Gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,</hi> then acquainted the Court that his Majeſty was graciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſed in mercy to the priſoner to wave the Out-lary, and to allow him liberty to make a defence for himſelf, if he were able to make any but he having nothing to ſay for himſelf, and confeſſing the ſaid Indictment, the Court then made a Rule that he ſhould be Executed on this day at <hi>Tyburn,</hi> as an Arch-Traytor, by being drawn, hang'd, and quartered.</p>
            <p>During the time of his Impriſonment, eſpecially after he was under a State of Condemnation, he behaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with modeſty &amp; penitence, but very reſerv'd, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing any particular but in general Terms acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf guilty of that Treaſon for which he ſtood out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law'd, and the puniſhment awarded him by Rule of Court to be Juſt upon him.</p>
            <p>On the 30th. of this Inſtant <hi>April,</hi> being <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> he was drawn upon a Sledge to <hi>Tyburn,</hi> and there Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as a Traytor.</p>
